# LuxembourgPathfinding

🔍 LuxembourgPathfinding is a Python application that finds the shortest path on a real-world map of Luxembourg using Dijkstra’s algorithm and XML data parsing. The program processes a map in OpenStreetMap XML format, extracts the graph representation of roads, and computes the shortest route between selected locations.

📌 Features
✅ Graph-based pathfinding – Implements Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest paths.
✅ Real-world data parsing – Reads a Luxembourg map from OpenStreetMap XML format.
✅ Graph visualization – Uses Pygame to display nodes, edges, and the computed path.
✅ Dynamic path selection – Allows the user to select starting and destination points.
✅ Optimized coordinate scaling – Normalizes latitude and longitude for visualization.

🛠️ Technologies Used
1. Python – Core programming language
2. Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Shortest path computation
3. XML Parsing – Extracting graph data from OpenStreetMap (.osm)
4. Pygame – Visualization of the graph and paths
